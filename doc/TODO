=head1 COMMAND LINE

=head2 ORDER BY

Current order is file, line, content. Order by content (aka file, content, line)
should be reasonable.

=head2 change --list--all to -a

=head2 add --help and --usage

=head2 combine -f/-F and -q/-Q

Filters and questions don't have to take arguments. Chaining won't
work if we keep it the current way. Maybe "-f Sub::Name,foo"
would do instead of "-f Sub::Name -F foo"? Same goes for -q/-Q.
